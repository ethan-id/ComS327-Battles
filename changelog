Battles with a wild Pokemon end with the capture of the wild Pokemon, with either the wild Pokemon or the trainer fleeing the battle, or with either the wild Pokemon or all of the trainer’s Pokemon getting knocked out.

Trainer battles end when all of one trainer’s Pokemon are knocked out. Trainer battles cannot be fled, and Pokemon are not available for capture in trainer battles.

A Pokemon is knocked out when it’s hitpoints fall to zero. 
A knocked out Pokemon is unavailable for battle until it is revived.


During battle, the PC has the following options, which should all be implemented in the battle place-
holder(s) that were added last week:
1. Fight - The active Pokemon uses one of its moves; player chooses the move if PC, otherwise the AI
chooses (see below).
2. Bag - Use an item from the trainer’s inventory. We will implement revives, potions, and Pok ́eballs
(more below)
3. Run - Attempt to flee the battle
4. Pokemon - Switch to a different active Pokemon. A trainer may have up to 6 active Pokemon.


The bag mechanic consumes an item from the trainer’s inventory. The trainer must be carrying the item
in order to use it. A revive will revive a knocked-out Pokemon and restore it to half its max HP. A potion will restore up to 20 HP, never taking the Pokemon above its max HP value. Pokeballs may only be used in battles with wild Pokemon and will attempt to capture them.


Start the PC with a small number of potions, revives, and Pok ́eballs.


Visiting a Pokemon Center shouldrestore and fully heal all of the PC’s Pokemon. Visiting a Pok ́eMart should restore the PC’s supplies (im-
plement a shopping mechanic if you would like, but all you need to do is restore the PC’s supplies to the
default numbers they started with). Implement the ’B’ command that will allow the PC to access the bag
outside of battle and apply restores and heals to party Pokemon.
